# Accessibility-and-Refactor

## Refactoring code for accessibility to optimnize SEO.

Given pre-built code and asked to find ways to improve and simplify for ease of reading through syntax and semantics. The assignment was to take anothers code and apply the scout method while also editing for accessibility needs. Through this process I learned new standards for accessibility (including adding alt tags to images.) and how to better set hierarchy within the code for ease of access for the next person viewing my code work. This also helped with easing me into using git, GitHub and managing a file repo.

## Installation

1.Clone the repository to your computer desktop.
2.Access your the top level directory.
3.Run the index.html file.
